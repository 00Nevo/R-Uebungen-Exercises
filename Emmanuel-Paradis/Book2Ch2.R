2.2.3 NULL
##ChatGpt doing a walkthrough of part of the code of the book:
z <- list(a = 1:2, b = 3)
    Here, you create a list z with two named elements:
        a contains the vector 1:2 (i.e., 1 2).
        b contains the scalar value 3.
z
##The list z will look like this:
$a
[1] 1 2
$b
[1] 3
##Next, you perform:
z[1] <- list(NULL)
What's happening:
    z[1] refers to the first element of the list z, which is a.
    By assigning NULL to z[1], you're removing the first element (a) but keeping the list structure. This essentially replaces the first element (a) with NULL.
Result after z[1] <- list(NULL):
z
This will result in the following output:
$a
NULL
$b
[1] 3

##without list
> z[1] <- NULL
2 > z
3 $b
4 [1] 3

##Explanation:
   ## The first element a is now replaced by NULL.
  ##  The second element b remains unchanged.
